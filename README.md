#PathPatrol_Maverick

Well, this is bsically a obstacle avoiding and lane tracking vehicle.
This was made as a mini project for college in a group of two, that is myself and my good friend Utsav Singh.

##Complications

Now even this project of ours do avoid obstacles while also following a specific path, it was not really build upto to its max potential.
And here are the problems we faced that led to this incompetency in this simple project:

- **Problem 1:** The vehicle was able to detect that there was an obstacle in front of it, but it was unable to maneuver itself out of the path to avoid colliding. As a result, it drove itself into the obstacle.

- **Solution 1:** This was not really a solution but an improvisation.

  Well, first of all, we had a deadline, so we could not just remain stuck on that problem. We had to move on, but I kept being stubborn about it and hoped that through multiple iterations of code or rewiring the hardware, we would crack it. Nonetheless, Utsav fortunately had an idea that would not really deviate us from the obstacle-avoiding promise we had made in this project, but also that idea would be good enough to at least present it as a viable mini-project for college.

  Now the idea might sound simple, but it was an appropriate one in that situation. So what we did is rigged the code so when the vehicle detects an obstacle instead of struggling to maneuver out of its way

  it would simply stop, now that does sound quite a downgrade and also limits a lot potential applications but for that time and place that was good enough for us.
